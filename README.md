# CSC 221 Intermediate Programming: Python

## Program Assignments
  #### Assignment 1: 
  - Write a Python program that will take one command-line argument and count the number of times that argument occurs on the standard input, then print the count to standard output.

  #### Assignment 2: 
  - Finish the Python module named shape.py by adding definitions for Ellipse and Circle, which should be related to Shape in the same way that Rectangle and Square are. Also write a main method in another module named main.py that instantiates several Shape objects, putting them in a list, then using a for loop to polymorphically call each object's calculateArea method and print each result.

## In Class Examples / Practice
#### practice.py: 
- This program was written on the first day of class and prints out hello 100 times. 


#### solution-x.py: 
- This set of programs were written to complete the following task in serveral different ways.
  - Reads from user, 2 numbers (x & y). 
  - Then prints the sequence of integers (one per line) going from x to y (including both )

#### find-csc.py:
- This program finds the first occurance of the string "CSC", case-insensitive, in the input stream and prints the line number it occurs on.

#### geometry & main.py
- These programs are an introduction to classes and importing into files. These programs have a Point object and a Rectangle object. The Rectangle object is created with a Point object acting as the upper left hand corner and a width and a height. The rectangle has a method to calculate the area of the rectangle.

#### shapes
- These programs are an introduction to abstract classes, subclasses, multiple inheritance, and super classes.
